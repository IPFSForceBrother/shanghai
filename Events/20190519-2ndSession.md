## Summary
This is a real deep-dive discussion of IPFS and Filecoin related topics, and very attractive to developers and researchers. 
The 3 speakers present their research and ideas regarding distributed storage, blockchain and how they bundle together, not only
 from technical point of view, but how it might evolve in near future or long run. 

 After the end of this session, all the attendees expect we could regularly have this kind of session to focus on protocol and 
 implementation, which is quite different than other 'popular' sessions which are more focusing on business or investment.
